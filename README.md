# CodeAlpa_task1
developed a  hangman project for CodeAlpha internship
Description
This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman Game using Python. The game allows the player to guess letters in a hidden word, and they have a limited number of wrong guesses before they "lose."

Features
Word is randomly chosen from a predefined list.
The player can guess letters one by one.
The game shows the current state of the word after each guess.
The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses (e.g., 6 chances).
The player can either win or lose based on their guesses.
Requirements
Python 3.x or later.
How to Play
When the game starts, a random word is selected, and you will see underscores representing the letters in the word.
Guess one letter at a time by typing it when prompted.
If the guessed letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the word.
If the guessed letter is not in the word, you lose one chance.
You win if you guess all the letters of the word before running out of chances.
